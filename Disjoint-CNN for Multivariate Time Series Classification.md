# Introduction
<br/> Multivariate TSC (MTSC) has more than one variables (channels).
<br/> The most of existing STOA algorithms don't consider itreactions of channels with each other.
<br/> The existing models consider time series data as a 1D image e and employ 1D convolution operations to extract features from the multivariate time series.
<br/> Here 1D convolution is converted into 2 unmixed and successive operations.
<br/> And here there are 2 main benefits: using additional nonlinear activtion functon and facilitating the optimization process.
