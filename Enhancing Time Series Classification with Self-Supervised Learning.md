# Introduction

Self-Supervised Learning (SSL) offers a promising avenue by learning discriminant latent spaces without explicit labels.<br/>
In this paper there is a novel approch for SSL it is name is TRILITE. <br/>
TRILITE uses the triplet loss, aiming to enhance feature learning. <br/>
This contribution includes novel time series augmentation, the use of triplet loss in SSL for TSC, and a new evaluation method demonstrating improved performance.
