# Introduction
<br/>This paper purposed the new model (LITE) that uses a technique to get the state of the art results.
<br/>Here Authors arged that models which have larger complexit are not necessary to get welll performance results.
<br/>However, LITE uses 2.34% of Inception's parameters and it achieves better results than other models (Inception, ResNet, FCN).
<br/>Here reucing of parameters is not only the benefit of LITE but also it reduces amount of CO2 and Power and also decreaces the training time.
