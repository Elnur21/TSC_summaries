# Introduction
This paper purposed the new model (LITE) that uses a technique to get the state of the art results.
Here Authors arged that models which have larger complexit are not necessary to get welll performance results.
However, LITE uses 2.34% of Inception's parameters and it achieves better results than other models (Inception, ResNet, FCN).
Here reucing of parameters is not only the benefit of LITE but also it reduces amount of CO2 and Power and also decreaces the training time.
