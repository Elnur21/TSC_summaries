# Introduction
Most methods for time series classification that attain state-of-the-art accuracy have high computational complexity, requiring significant training time even for smaller datasets, and simply do not scale to large datasets.



Instead of using predefined features, CNNs use convolutional kernels to automatically detect patterns in the input data.
CNNs offer a flexible and powerful approach to time series classification by automatically learning relevant features from the data, including patterns, shapes, and frequency information.
