# Introduction
<br/>TSC predicts categorical labels from ordered sets of real-valued attributes.
<br/>TSER predicts numeric outputs to understand relationships between time series and extrinsic variables.
<br/>Deep learning has potential but hasn't consistently outperformed traditional methods due to dataset size and hardware limitations.
<br/>In this paper various architectures and enhancements like  MLPs, CNNs, RNNs, GNNs are discussed.
