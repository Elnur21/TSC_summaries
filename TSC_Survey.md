# Introduction
<br/>TSC predicts categorical values.
<br/>TSER predicts continuous values for external variables.
<br/>Deep learning has potential but hasn't consistently outperformed traditional methods due to dataset size and hardware limitations.
<br/>In this paper various architectures and enhancements like  MLPs, CNNs, RNNs, GNNs are discussed.
